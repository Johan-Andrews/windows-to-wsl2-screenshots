# Windows-to-WSL2 Screenshot Bridge

üöÄ **Auto-save Windows screenshots to WSL2 and paste paths directly into Claude Code**

This tool was created to solve the annoying workflow of taking screenshots in Windows and getting them into Claude Code in WSL2. It automatically saves your screenshots and copies the file path to your clipboard so you can just Ctrl+V into Claude Code.

## What it does

1. **Take screenshot** (Win+Shift+S, Win+PrintScreen, etc.)
2. **Auto-saves** to `~/.screenshots/` in WSL2  
3. **Auto-copies path** to clipboard
4. **Paste into Claude Code** with Ctrl+V

Perfect for the Claude Code workflow where you need to quickly share screenshots.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- Any WSL2 distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Works best with **Windows Terminal** (from Microsoft Store)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/windows-to-wsl2-screenshots.git
cd windows-to-wsl2-screenshots
source screenshot-functions.sh
start-screenshot-monitor
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start the automation
start-screenshot-monitor

# Check if running
check-screenshot-status

# Stop when done
stop-screenshot-monitor
```

Now just take screenshots and paste paths directly into Claude Code!

## Troubleshooting

**Clipboard not working?** 
- Use Windows Terminal (Microsoft Store app) instead of basic Ubuntu terminal
- Basic WSL terminals have clipboard sync issues

**Monitor not starting?**
```bash
# Check the log
cat ~/.screenshots/monitor.log
```

## Notes

- Tested on one system so far (mine) - your results may vary
- Created specifically for Claude Code workflows
- Also works with any tool that needs screenshot file paths
- **Uses PowerShell ExecutionPolicy Bypass** - required for the automation to work, only affects this specific script
- **Developed with Claude Code** - if you need customizations or run into issues, try asking Claude Code to help modify the scripts!
